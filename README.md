# Responsive Carousel  
This is a test project, to recreate a carousel similar to the one on the main page of [enduro-mtb.com](https://enduro-mtb.com/en/).
It is written in vanilla Javascript.
The features:
- Responsive: the number of displayed slides depends on the window size
- Both left/right buttons and touch gestures are available  

I used this to test:
- Handling of touch gestures in Javascript
- Editing of CSS variables in JS

## Demo
